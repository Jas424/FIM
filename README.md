# File Integrity Monitor

## Overview

The File Integrity Monitor is a host-based system designed to ensure the integrity of files on a user's personal computer. This tool, built using PowerShell, allows users to monitor changes in file hash values, ensuring any unauthorized modifications are detected promptly.

## Features

- **Set Baseline:** Allows users to select a CSV file to set as the baseline for monitoring.
- **Add Files to Baseline:** Users can add files to the baseline, registering their file paths and hash values for future checks.
- **Check Files Against Baseline:** Compares current file hashes with the baseline to detect modifications or deletions.
- **Check Files with Email Notifications:** Similar to the previous feature but includes email notifications for any detected changes.
- **Create New Baseline:** Enables users to create a new, empty baseline file in the correct CSV format.
- **Restore Backup Files:** Allows users to restore files from a backup directory to preserve system integrity in case of malware attacks.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Provides near real-time alerts by continuously verifying files against the baseline at user-specified intervals.
- **Email Monitoring:** Sends immediate alerts to a specified email address if any changes are detected.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jas424/FIM.git
    cd v2.ps1
    ```

2. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have PowerShell installed on your system.
    - Install the required Mime Kit libraries for email operations.

## Usage and Demo

1. **Set Baseline:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 1
    ```

2. **Add Files to Baseline:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 2
    ```

3. **Check Files Against Baseline:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 3
    ```

4. **Check Files with Email Notifications:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 4 -Email your-email@example.com
    ```

5. **Create New Baseline:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 5
    ```

6. **Restore Backup Files:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 6
    ```

7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    ```powershell
    .\v2.ps1 -Option 7 -Interval 300
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Set Baseline:**
    - The user selects a CSV file, which is set as the baseline for the system. This file contains the initial hash values of the monitored files.

2. **Add Files to Baseline:**
    - The function calculates the hash value of the selected file and adds it to the baseline CSV file.

3. **Check Files Against Baseline:**
    - The script compares the current hash values of the files against the baseline. Any modifications or deletions trigger an alert.

4. **Check Files with Email Notifications:**
    - Similar to the regular check, but also sends an email alert if any changes are detected.

5. **Create New Baseline:**
    - This option creates a new, empty baseline CSV file, ensuring proper format and structure.

6. **Restore Backup Files:**
    - The script restores files from a backup directory, preserving the integrity of the system in case of an attack.

7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    - The script continuously monitors the files at specified intervals, providing close to real-time alerts for any detected changes.

## Backup and Restore

- The tool includes a "Back Up and Restore" feature that stores a copy of the baseline file and monitored directory in a separate backup directory.
- The script generates timestamped subfolders within the backup directory to ensure distinct backups.
- Users can restore files from the backup directory if malware compromises the system.

## Email Notifications

- The tool integrates an email feature to send immediate alerts to a specified email address.
- This is achieved using the Mime Kit libraries for secure email operations.


## DEMO 

-  In this scenario, the user downloads a malware disguised as a shortcut. Upon clicking the malware, the files are deleted! Since the user has the continous monitoring function (option 7) turned on, the user is  notified in red text on the console.

- User is notfied vis email as well!

-Luckily, the user is able to restore the file as the tool stored backups of the baselines and the files in the directory.
